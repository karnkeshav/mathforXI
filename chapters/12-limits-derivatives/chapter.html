<!-- SECTION 1 -->
<section id="why">
  <div class="concept">
    <h2>Why Calculus Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Before calculus, mathematics was very good at answering questions like:
      “How much in total?” and “What is the average?”
    </p>
    <p>
      But many real-world questions are different.
      They ask:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How fast is a car moving <strong>right now</strong>?</li>
      <li>How quickly is a population growing <strong>at this moment</strong>?</li>
      <li>What is the slope of a curve <strong>at one exact point</strong>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Algebra cannot answer these questions.
      Calculus was invented to handle change that happens continuously.
    </p>

    <div class="think">
      Think: Why is “average speed” not the same as “speed at an instant”?
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section id="approach">
  <div class="concept">
    <h2>Approaching a Point</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you are walking toward a door.
      With every step, you get closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before touching the door, you can clearly see
      where you are going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathematics does something similar.
      Instead of jumping directly to a point,
      it looks at what happens as we move closer and closer.
    </p>

    <div class="think">
      Key idea: Getting close is different from actually reaching.
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 3 -->
<section id="limit">
  <div class="concept">
    <h2>What Is a Limit?</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>limit</strong> describes what a value is trying to become
      as we approach a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The important idea is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value at the point may not matter</li>
      <li>The behaviour near the point is what matters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is why limits are about <em>behaviour</em>, not substitution.
    </p>

    <div class="think">
      A limit answers: “What number do we get closer and closer to?”
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 4 -->
<section id="derivative">
  <div class="concept">
    <h2>What Is a Derivative?</h2>
    <p>
      A derivative measures how fast something changes
      at one exact instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Speed is the derivative of distance</li>
      <li>Slope is the derivative of a curve</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The derivative is built using limits.
      First we understand approaching,
      then limits,
      and finally derivatives.
    </p>

      Big picture: Derivative = limit of average change
